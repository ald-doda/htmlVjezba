    <h3>Matrices</h3>
    <p>
    A matrix is a rectangular arrangement of numbers, symbols, or expressions in rows and columns. 
    The size of a matrix is defined by the number of rows and columns it contains. 
    For example, a 2x3 matrix has 2 rows and 3 columns.
    </p>

    <p>
    Matrices are very useful in mathematics because they allow us to organize data efficiently and perform calculations systematically. 
    One of the simplest operations is matrix addition. Two matrices can be added only if they have the same dimensions. 
    For example, consider these two 2x2 matrices:
    <br>
    Matrix A = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]<br>
    Matrix B = [[5, 6], [7, 8]]
    <br>
    Their sum, A + B, is [[6, 8], [10, 12]].
    </p>

    <p>
    Another basic operation is matrix subtraction, which works similarly to addition. 
    Multiplying a matrix by a scalar means multiplying each element of the matrix by that number. 
    For instance, 2 * A = [[2, 4], [6, 8]].
    </p>

    <p>
    Matrix multiplication is slightly more complex. The number of columns in the first matrix must equal the number of rows in the second matrix. 
    For example, if Matrix C = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]] and Matrix D = [[7, 8], [9, 10], [11, 12]], 
    then the product C * D = [[58, 64], [139, 154]].
    </p>

    <p>
    One more important concept is the transpose of a matrix. The transpose of a matrix is obtained by swapping its rows and columns. 
    For example, the transpose of Matrix A = [[1, 2], [3, 4]] is [[1, 3], [2, 4]].
    </p>

    <p>
    Matrices are widely used in many real-world applications such as computer graphics, physics simulations, engineering problems, and economics. 
    They help represent complex data in a simple and structured way, making calculations faster and easier to manage.
    </p>

    <h3>Determinants</h3>
    <p>
    The determinant is a special number that can be calculated from a square matrix. 
    Determinants are important in linear algebra because they help us determine whether a system of linear equations has a unique solution, and whether a matrix is invertible.
    </p>

    <p>
    For a 2x2 matrix, the determinant is calculated as follows. 
    If Matrix A = [[a, b], [c, d]], then the determinant of A, written as det(A), is:
    <br>
    det(A) = a*d - b*c
    <br>
    For example, if A = [[3, 5], [2, 7]], then det(A) = (3*7) - (5*2) = 21 - 10 = 11.
    </p>

    <p>
    Determinants of larger matrices, such as 3x3, are calculated using a method called cofactor expansion. 
    For example, if B = [[1, 2, 3], [0, 4, 5], [1, 0, 6]], the determinant is calculated as:
    <br>
    det(B) = 1*(4*6 - 5*0) - 2*(0*6 - 5*1) + 3*(0*0 - 4*1) = 1*24 - 2*(-5) + 3*(-4) = 24 + 10 - 12 = 22.
    </p>

    <p>
    Determinants have several key properties that make calculations easier: 
    <br>
    - Swapping two rows changes the sign of the determinant.  
    - Multiplying a row by a scalar multiplies the determinant by that scalar.  
    - If a matrix has a row of zeros, its determinant is zero.  
    - The determinant of a triangular matrix is the product of its diagonal elements.
    </p>

    <p>
    Determinants are used in solving systems of equations with Cramer's rule, finding inverses of matrices, and in many applications in physics and engineering, such as calculating area, volume, and transformations.

    <h3>Matrix Equations</h3>
    <p>
    A matrix equation is an equation in which the unknowns are matrices. 
    These equations are often used to represent and solve systems of linear equations in a compact and organized way.
    </p>

    <p>
    The simplest form of a matrix equation is:
    <br>
    A * X = B
    <br>
    where A and B are known matrices, and X is the unknown matrix that we want to find. 
    To solve for X, we often use the inverse of matrix A (if it exists) and multiply both sides of the equation:
    <br>
    X = A<sup>-1</sup> * B
    </p>

    <p>
    For example, consider the system of two equations with two unknowns:
    <br>
    2x + 3y = 8  
    1x + 2y = 5
    <br>
    We can write it in matrix form as:
    <br>
    A = [[2, 3], [1, 2]], B = [[8], [5]], X = [[x], [y]]
    <br>
    Then the matrix equation is: A * X = B
    </p>

    <p>
    To solve for X, we calculate the inverse of A:
    <br>
    A<sup>-1</sup> = [[2, -3], [-1, 2]]  (scaled appropriately by 1/det(A))  
    Multiplying A<sup>-1</sup> * B gives X = [[1], [2]], which means x = 1 and y = 2.
    </p>

    <p>
    Matrix equations can also involve multiple unknown matrices or more complex operations, but the principle remains the same: 
    express the system compactly, check for invertibility, and solve using matrix operations.
    </p>

    <p>
    These equations are widely used in computer graphics, engineering simulations, economics models, and anywhere systems of linear equations arise.

    <h3>Vectors</h3>
    <p>
    A vector is a mathematical quantity that has both magnitude (length) and direction. 
    Vectors are used to represent physical quantities such as force, velocity, and displacement. 
    Unlike scalars, which have only magnitude, vectors provide information about direction as well.
    </p>

    <p>
    Vectors are usually written in component form. 
    For example, a 2-dimensional vector can be written as **v = [3, 4]**, where 3 is the x-component and 4 is the y-component. 
    The magnitude of this vector can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:
    <br>
    |v| = √(3² + 4²) = √(9 + 16) = 5
    </p>

    <p>
    One basic operation with vectors is addition. 
    Two vectors of the same dimension can be added by adding their corresponding components. 
    For example, if u = [1, 2] and v = [3, 4], then their sum is:
    <br>
    u + v = [1+3, 2+4] = [4, 6]
    </p>

    <p>
    Scalar multiplication is another common operation. 
    Multiplying a vector by a scalar changes its magnitude but not its direction. 
    For instance, 2 * u = 2 * [1, 2] = [2, 4].
    </p>

    <p>
    Vectors can also be represented graphically as arrows, where the length represents magnitude and the arrow points in the direction of the vector. 
    This is useful in physics and engineering to visualize forces and motion.
    </p>

    <p>
    Understanding vectors is essential for fields such as physics, engineering, computer graphics, and 3D modeling. 
    Mastering vector operations helps solve problems involving motion, forces, and spatial reasoning.
    </p>

    <h3>Vector Cross Product</h3>
    <p>
    The cross product of two vectors is an operation that produces a third vector which is perpendicular to both original vectors. 
    It is used in 3-dimensional space to find directions, areas of parallelograms, and in physics to describe torque and rotational forces.
    </p>

    <p>
    If we have two 3D vectors, u = [u1, u2, u3] and v = [v1, v2, v3], the cross product, written as u × v, is calculated using the determinant of a 3x3 matrix:
    <br>
    u × v = | i    j    k  |<br>
             | u1  u2  u3 |<br>
             | v1  v2  v3 |
    <br>
    where i, j, k are the unit vectors along the x, y, z axes.
    </p>

    <p>
    For example, let u = [1, 2, 3] and v = [4, 5, 6].  
    Then the cross product u × v is:
    <br>
    u × v = [(2*6 - 3*5), (3*4 - 1*6), (1*5 - 2*4)] = [-3, 6, -3]
    </p>

    <p>
    The resulting vector [-3, 6, -3] is perpendicular to both u and v. 
    Its magnitude represents the area of the parallelogram formed by u and v:
    <br>
    |u × v| = √((-3)² + 6² + (-3)²) = √(9 + 36 + 9) = √54 ≈ 7.35
    </p>

    <p>
    The cross product is widely used in physics to calculate torque, rotational motion, and in computer graphics to determine normals to surfaces. 
    Understanding the cross product helps in solving 3D geometry problems and visualizing spatial relationships.
    </p>

    <h3>Analytic Geometry</h3>
    <p>
    Analytic geometry, also called coordinate geometry, studies geometric objects using a coordinate system. 
    By representing points, lines, and shapes with coordinates, we can use algebraic methods to solve geometric problems.
    </p>

    <p>
    A point in 2D space is represented as (x, y), and in 3D space as (x, y, z). 
    For example, the points A = (1, 2) and B = (4, 6) lie in a 2-dimensional plane. 
    Using these coordinates, we can calculate distances, slopes, and midpoints.
    </p>

    <p>
    The distance between two points A(x₁, y₁) and B(x₂, y₂) is given by the formula:
    <br>
    d = √((x₂ - x₁)² + (y₂ - y₁)²)
    <br>
    For our points A = (1, 2) and B = (4, 6):
    <br>
    d = √((4-1)² + (6-2)²) = √(3² + 4²) = √25 = 5
    </p>

    <p>
    The equation of a line passing through two points A(x₁, y₁) and B(x₂, y₂) can be written as:
    <br>
    y - y₁ = ((y₂ - y₁)/(x₂ - x₁)) * (x - x₁)
    <br>
    For example, the line through A = (1, 2) and B = (4, 6) has slope m = (6-2)/(4-1) = 4/3, 
    so its equation is y - 2 = (4/3)(x - 1).
    </p>

    <p>
    Analytic geometry also allows finding intersections of lines, equations of circles, planes in 3D, and other curves using algebra. 
    This combination of algebra and geometry provides powerful tools for solving complex problems in mathematics, physics, and engineering.
    </p>

    <p>
    By mastering analytic geometry, learners can better visualize mathematical concepts and apply them to real-world spatial problems.
